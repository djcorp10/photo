== Photo Upload

RADAR is reporting system for the Resident Assistants, Hall Directors, 
and the Office of Residence Life at Saint Maryâ€™s University. It was 
developed by a team of five students using Ruby on Rails in 2011, and 
is still currently in use. I developed the ability to upload photos 
with each report to further document the information.
